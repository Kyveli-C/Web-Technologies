Description: Online store selling UClan merchandise.

1.	Contains a homepage (index.html): Page is named correctly, and functions as a template for all remaining pages. All media is correctly embedded, using an ‘iFrame’ to display any (supplied) external media content

2.	Applies HTML appropriately: HTML is structured appropriately and follows best practice, e.g., organises content based on three core sections: header, content, footer, which are identified appropriately for styling.

3.	Applies CSS appropriately: Styling and branding is applied consistently across all completed pages and elements. Some attempt to differentiate between selector types, although ‘classes’ have mainly been used.

4.	Includes a video demo: A short video capture with voice-over (e.g., Microsoft Teams recording) of the functionality and code for each page which you have included in your application (max. 3 minutes overall).
//
5.	Complete a lab demo: As directed by your tutor; allowing you to answer questions and demonstrate any advanced functionality. Note that absence of a lab demo will restrict the maximum grade to a ‘pass’ (above).

6.	Clear and commented code: Code is clearly presented, with recognisable elements, using comments (where appropriate) to explain the (core) function of each element, and associated CSS selector, as applied.

7.	Homepage passes validation: 
//
8.	(Basic) Products page: Selection of products (3) are listed for purchase, with all attributes suitably formatted as HTML elements. Suitable CSS formatting is applied. Out-of-stock items are differentiable from ‘last=few', 'good-stock’. Added display option all. I 

9.	Clear, and varied navigation: Main navigation is clear and adapts responsively. Sub navigation used to navigate around and between all pages in the application, providing a variety of navigation options.

10.	Responsive design considerations: The layout of pages should adapt to the available screen dimensions.
//
11.	(Advanced) Products page: Page should be fully functional, correctly applying JavaScript to present the full inventory of products. Customer may filter ‘in-stock’ items and has option to ‘view more’ info. for each item.

12.	(Basic) Item page: Should be mostly functional, and accessible ONLY from the embedded links within the products page (and the cart page where appropriate), making use of sessionStorage to set and retrieve data.

13.	Mobile navigation considerations: Pages work effectively on a mobile screen, demonstrated via mobile emulation within the browser, e.g., formatting primary navigation for pages to represent a ‘hamburger menu’.
//
14.	(Basic) shopping cart: The structure, styling and functionality of the cart has been implemented. Page should query localStorage API (as set within a fully functional Item page) and visualise content appropriately.

15.	(Advanced) Item page: Page should be fully functional, making correct use of appropriate HTML5 API (local Storage) to set and retrieve data for the shopping cart. Page should offer a ‘Add to Cart’ button to actuate this.

16.	HTML5 semantic elements: Include and explain (via commentary of first instance in the code, and as part of lab demo when prompted) application of HTML5 semantic mark-up, as applied throughout your application.
